[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:18:45
Uh, no, I'm not getting…

[iPhone] 22:18:48
Wait, let me check that, uh, how to…

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:18:50
But I think it will get, bro. Once can I stop the recording, so we'll see.

[iPhone] 22:18:54
Oh, yeah, yeah.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:19:06
Oh, here we are getting right.

[iPhone] 22:19:08
Oh, I didn't see your… I lost your screen.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:19:12
Ah, right side, Zoom only.

[iPhone] 22:19:15
Zoom only, what? Oh, transcript.

[iPhone] 22:19:19
Oh, that's all the… yeah, yeah, I can see the transcript, bro.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:19:19
You are seeing completely.

[iPhone] 22:19:22
So this is what, like, after completing our recording, we need to clear this transcript.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:19:28
Okay, save this transcript, okay, okay. Okay, bro.

[iPhone] 22:19:31
Okay, so now stop the recording and record only that video.

[iPhone] 22:19:51
Wait, wait, bro, wait, bro. So, uh…

[iPhone] 22:19:53
Uh… okay.

[iPhone] 22:19:56
Okay, you can play, I will also listen some points.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:20:00
Yeah, as I am recording first.

[iPhone] 22:20:05
Don't talk after that. Like, if anything, just ping me in the WhatsApp.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:20:08
Okay, okay.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:20:32
So now we are starting at power 1, 3, 2.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:20:35
366, this is for CAP 326. Resume Acquisition and servicing quotes for Safe Code Hub.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:20:42
The 80 statements are.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:20:49
Gold Hub, acquisition servicing. I will send details of saved auto acquisition and servicing codes to the CodeHub. Note CodeHub will consume this code data and pre-fill in auto cards in CodeHub.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:21:00
New details will align with the acquisition view details page on Automot's site, which is addressed as priority.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:21:07
As part of Priority 1. Ability to render all saved.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:21:12
not taken withdrawal Expert Acquisition and servicing quotes in the.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:21:17
Autop, auto tile. For servicing members should not be able to view unsaved, not manually saved quotes on.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:21:24
What up? This is what we are discussing, right, JP, and then expired code, sir.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:21:30
More than 60 years old from the… First entry date.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:21:34
An ability to present renewal message in CourtHub. For policy change.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:21:41
Quote, ability to hide the renewal message if renewal date has already.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:21:46
You've passed normal messages. Message presented, and then apply auto LOB filter systematically when the land from storehub and member home.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:21:55
The ability to use uniquely assign code number identifier, or safe courthouse, on code.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:22:01
originated from Gerdwar. And there is a guidework card.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:22:06
That was… that is referenced here, which was… this work was done.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:22:12
For us to get the code number and show it on the UI.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:22:19
Or, you know, previous, um, story, we said that we will not show the IP changed.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:22:26
quotes, because there is a separate tile for that.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:22:32
You have 3 tiles, right? Um…

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:22:38
In the policy. Mm-hmm.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:22:43
We have two types, new and policy update, and here.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:22:47
We display all of the. Policy updates or quotes?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:22:53
By the member.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:23:00
Okay. So, what do you mean by tab, or… Yeah, he was thinking that, like, pre… auto policy itself, we have, um… The acquisition-related one, then servicing rate, policy change related.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:23:15
And within that itself. There are one is for member.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:23:22
Um, the. dependence, then there is another one, IP, and that I thought that way.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:23:28
Yes, yes, JP, actually, that is gonna be there eventually.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:23:32
So you're thinking, what you're thinking is right, but right now it's not refined yet.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:23:37
So if you see here, right, we show who entered it, so by USAA is the one by the IP.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:23:44
Yeah, but this Isabella is the one by the.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:23:49
I suppose, right? So that's gonna be there. But IEP ones… they will not see unless IEP indicates that one.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:23:58
To be seen by the member. That is… There is a feature under 36.3.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:24:04
for core team to support this work. So they will be… when IP creates a code, and they need the member to continue.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:24:12
Complete e-signature. Basically, main. need for that will be when IP completes a code, but once the.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:24:20
the member to sign it. be able to send the code from Guideware.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:24:25
to the IP, uh, to the customer, sorry. So members will be able to proceed.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:24:31
And sign it and complete it. Okay, got it, got it, yeah. Thank you.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:24:35
So that's gonna be there, but uh… right now it's not… we haven't got to this part. These features are still pending.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:24:42
Actually, these were supposed to be part of the two features I gave you guys.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:24:46
That we were discussing yesterday, right? 70 and 76.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:24:50
But that's becoming too big, so what I did is I've broken it down further.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:24:54
So, must we describe. The entire page separately and then each card individually separately. So, I'm going to refine these today.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:25:02
And then we'll share those with you. Got it.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:25:08
Background? Yeah, okay. So, going back to the feature.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:25:14
Okay, let's read the ACS. Send safe code data to Safe Code Hub for auto acquisition and servicing on members on Safe CodeHub and members existing code saved in the system.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:25:25
For acquisition and or servicing for personal auto. Code status is not taken, withdrawn, or expired, then display the eligible and quote information.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:25:35
Personal auto? And, uh… Then the eligibility rule for displaying quotes will be… Covered in subsequent AC.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:25:47
So, new policies, like I showed you guys, is for acquisition.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:25:50
And, uh, Policy Updates tab is for servicing. Now, we'll go over… Ah, eligibility, so first is, uh… acquisition and servicing, given members on Safe Quota, when member has existing equation servicing code saved in the system.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:26:07
then do not show quotes that are older than 60 days.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:26:10
Validation only, since, as per the Safe Quota's quote older than 60 days are not.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:26:17
displayed. So, I wasn't sure if this is validation only or not, but you guys can check and let me know, and I'll remove this if… You'll have to make changes for it.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:26:31
Next is a safe code hub. Quote eligibility.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:26:36
Yeah, any questions so far? Sorry. Take a pause here. 1 and 2.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:26:51
Safecoat eligibility servicing and saved quotes. Given members in Safe Code Hub.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:26:56
Policy Updates tab. Of course, this one is for servicing.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:27:01
Inventile for personal auto loots, then do not show servicing codes that were not saved by the member explicitly during the transaction.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:27:09
These are the transaction might maybe sit…

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:27:17
Yeah.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:27:28
Yes. Yes, yes, double, I mean, double six.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:27:44
69 is sent to me. 6, 9, not double six, six, nine.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:28:00
Yes, as I told you initially. It will be around here.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:28:10
No, you wait.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:31:11
hardware, but both were not explicitly saved. For acquisition member goes past location and that all codes are saved.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:31:21
Same. Actually, let's add a clarification here, same. Or greater.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:31:27
Great, JP, that's what we decided. If it is rated, then it will be considered saved.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:31:37
Oh… Um… Yeah.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:31:43
Saved as quotes. unrated, right?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:31:49
Undergraded. But will not be… Or, sorry, what is that? But underrated won't be there in both the updates, right? Yeah, it does.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:32:01
Not. And when it is quoted, it is actually rated.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:32:07
Okay. That's what I'm adding. This makes more sense. There is nothing like that, right?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:32:13
code status not quoted scenario in policy update. We are not saving, right, explicitly as well.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:32:21
But it'll be in draft status in Guideware, right? So should I say boat status draft?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:32:27
Yeah, drafted will not show for policy updates at all.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:32:33
liquidity will all of this, I'm creating more confusion than needed. You know what to do, right?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:32:38
I'll just leave it here. Okay.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:32:43
Moving on scenario 4. Safecoat our renewal message. Give members on Safe CodeHub, when tiled for personal auto loads.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:32:50
In the policy updates tab. And policy change transaction is saved with the future effective date of renewal. Renewal is yet to be in effect.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:32:58
And show message updates will take. After the title summary of changes.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:33:06
So, this is specific to acquisition. and renewal is… is pending, and there is a… Go ahead and make the scenario 3, I guess.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:33:15
Sorry, yes, sir. I'm a little late. Okay. So, when we say.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:33:23
Never explicitly during the transaction, not saved by member explicitly, right?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:33:29
So you don't want to show those messages, that means we'll only show if members saved it.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:33:35
That is, like, quote only quoted. just want to get the information.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:33:40
Uh, yes, they cannot save. Before… Before, quote.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:33:45
Before Coverages page, we do not give them an option to save.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:33:48
So they cannot save it explicitly. I'm talking about the policies here.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:33:55
Yes, yes. It is possible to change only scenario 3, so… from cabredes only are going to give us a.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:34:03
So… Correct. But, uh… If they don't click and show that pop-up, right, when they want to leave and pop up… We asked 3 things, right? Exit without saving.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:34:16
say without our calculator, whatever it is. So, suppose if they select exit without saving, do you want me to delete that code from guideway?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:34:24
It may be quoted already. No, isn't there something that Shannon has sent us?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:34:30
Yesterday, I should discuss with the guide whoever was not able to join, that's why I'm asking. No, I did not discuss. I'll join the solution sink today and bring that up.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:34:41
Okay, but I think we'll need to… Have you already?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:34:46
We already were at, like, 510, 5.15, so… I didn't wanna… Okay.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:34:52
take the time, but I forgot also. Because we continued talking about SR thing.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:34:58
Okay, I remember that. 1, 3, 2, 3, 6, 6, okay.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:35:02
Okay. So, I think this AC, should I modify it?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:35:13
you don't need to say all the… that thing. This is only per… say a code one, right?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:35:21
So, talk about, uh, like, what we are going to do in the… don't talk about what we are doing in servicing transaction. Directly say what should happen in Policy Hub.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:35:30
So, it should show only the quoted transactions… quoted servicing quotes, right?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:35:36
The social servicing codes. In quoted also, if they say, do not save, then we don't show, right?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:35:42
Yeah, that attribute I need, what is that attribute? If guideware is going to store some attribute.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:35:49
pay member safety term, member doesn't save it. So I need something, right? Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, that's what we… that's what we are discussing here.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:36:01
But Shannon said, like, she don't want to delete from Guideware. She wants to have some flags kind of thing, I don't know whether Geidler has it, or has it already, or whether we need it. Yeah, let me… let's do this. I'll send her note to… Salvo and Anthony were… because she copied them.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:36:18
and G2 also, and I'll copy you both. Okie-talk, so we can take it from there. If needed, we can discuss in sync, solution sync, also related to that.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:36:27
Okay. Okay. So, then do not show the servicing quotes. Then this AC, I feel like, is a little too descriptive, and we may not need it.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:36:37
So, what I will do here is, so the network… That one not saved by the member explicitly.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:36:50
Of course. Network model.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:36:59
Not able to think what I should do here.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:37:03
The two types of codes will come in case of policy change, right? Either explicitly saved.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:37:10
Or, Gordon also. He has not clicked explicitly, but, um… Ah, yes.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:37:17
That were… do not show. Then show… Servicing codes that were… saved.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:37:27
that were quoted. Noted. Actually, sorry.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:37:32
Do not show the servicing codes that were not.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:37:35
Rated. Rated. Right?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:37:39
Yeah, rating, it will be quoted. Marked?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:37:47
Exit without… Saving by the member explicitly during the transaction. Okay, now this.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:37:55
What happens when this happens? that we can discuss, and… find a solution, either we are deleting it, or whether we have ability in Guidewire 2.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:38:04
Marketers hidden, right? Cool. The school is stronger, but.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:38:11
You are taking action. All these issues, like, we are talking about showing or taking action.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:38:19
Your visit, like, get all the data from API and put filters in the UI?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:38:26
To display, not to display. Uh… This will not be a UI filter.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:38:34
If I'm understanding your question correctly. Just give me one second, let me… Alright, got it. Language here.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:39:01
Forgetting these updates. Okay. So, let me come back to this.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:39:07
There are two types of rules. One is eligibility.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:39:13
When it becomes available. For the Safe Code Hub.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:39:18
So, a quote will be displayed here. made available here. Only if.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:39:23
Those rules that we are reviewing. Successful. And then, once they are here.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:39:28
Then we have additional filtering rules. in this UI, and those you can see… In one of these, yeah, here.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:39:37
So, we will be responsible for also setting this.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:39:41
filter quotes. Auto insurance here, whether it is.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:39:46
New policy or policy updates. When we are redirecting our.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:39:49
We are rendering this page. From the dim auto experience for servicing.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:39:56
also remember whom, and they start an auto-port or resume autocort, then they will land here, and they will.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:40:01
going to that respective tab for acquisition and servicing, and we'll be setting this filter.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:40:06
But this is what the UI-based filter. Yes. And everything else that we are talking about.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:40:13
is how a code. What are the rules for code to be shown?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:40:19
Within this. Within this section. Okay. Does that help?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:40:25
So, uh… go back to the feature. So, when you say, let's say.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:40:31
NEST number 1. Display the eligible code information and stuff.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:40:39
These conditions will be in the APA before they.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:40:47
With the response?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:40:52
Yeah, yeah. We have technical features, which is… filtering and bringing in.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:40:58
Only whatever is needed to show anyway. Okay, so before the data reaches the UA, I trigger all these rules and make sure.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:41:09
To get the data accordingly. Okay, and is there… do we have mapping for this, uh… Which, for example, when we say, like, rated by member, how do I identify the data? Because.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:41:24
Thank you. It is just the code status, right? It's quoted.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:41:32
learning happened or not. That will happen when you are doing premium calculation.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:41:38
That is a time the code status is changing to quoter.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:41:43
Mmm, yes.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:41:51
Okay. So, I'm gonna go through all the receipts over here to make sure, like, all the ACs are, you know, identifiable and… Um, backup.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:42:00
Okay, sounds good.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:42:09
you're good to go.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:42:17
We read the AC4 renewal message. But that is what I was gonna show you. Let's just read the next one also, and then we'll see the figure.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:42:25
So you've got a forum store. from storefront or member home.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:42:31
Still interested, personalized card. I have not seen this one.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:42:37
Where is this screen and… how this happens, but there is some card I was told.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:42:44
If they click on that link. and come here, then they will be landing to.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:42:50
New policies, new policies tab. So, as default on this page, and they'll see all the.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:42:59
First a lot of acquisition quotes for this member.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:43:12
And then the last one is unique code number display when member lands on Safe CodeHub, they display the unique code number originated from GuideWire for each individual. This one is.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:43:22
going to be provided by Guidewire. So I will show you the designs for… Oh, I didn't read the 4.1, sorry, I read 4.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:43:33
Or that one is when we hide the message.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:43:36
When renewal is in effect, so let's treat this one.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:43:39
must be sure the message when renewal is in effect.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:43:43
Okay, but future data renewal is out there, then we show the message updates will take effect.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:43:48
Right? And when? The renewal is in effect now.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:43:52
Then we do not show this message anymore. So we have to show or hide the message as per this, uh… Is she?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:44:06
And the Figma, I couldn't see that feature number.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:44:10
Yeah, these are enterprise Figma, and they do not add feature numbers, is what they're saying, so we are also struggling with it, JP, so I'm trying to… That's why, while going over these, we are trying to add all the links.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:44:23
Okay. This is acquisition. Their practice is not to add those things here, which is a little weird. I did request them, but they said they'll bring their designer in.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:44:34
And maybe see if they can do it once we are done with the refinement, since we are still refining.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:44:39
I am not, uh… I am not, uh… I have not asked them to get the designer in. Once my refinement is done, then I will try to see if I can add some kind of pointer or something, so you guys at least know the feature number.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:44:54
Or where to look for. In the future…

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:45:03
Renewal messages…

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:45:25
Yeah, here.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:45:33
Let me see, I'll try to add these. For your.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:45:39
Okay, thanks.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:45:46
Doesn't let me copy the link. Okay, historically, so what I will do is I'll copy that.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:45:53
PNG and put it in the…

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:46:01
Okay, I'm gonna add the link. When you're clicking on that list, overall, that rectangle, right?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:46:06
Is it not showing the link at the top?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:46:09
Yeah, excellent. I mean, I can add the whole section link.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:46:14
That I can do, but this one, it's not letting copy link, see?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:46:21
So the entire thing is transaction for them. This entire thing is 16. I'll get the feature numbers inserted here, don't worry.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:46:29
That I can do sometime next week, maybe. done with this if I need.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:46:36
I'll put the link in for you, okay. So you can reference it here in the feature.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:46:43
Okay, and then the next one was… I think the message that obviously is no Figma there.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:46:49
safe code hub, we've already seen how it looks like when we land, and… Policy tab, I'll show that again.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:46:55
And then the last thing was, uh… For, uh… Court number, so… When we land here on Safe Code Hub.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:47:05
Bronx Figma? When we land on Safe Code Hub?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:47:12
Here, it defaults to. Like I said, new policy.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:47:17
And all the auto policies are listed, and the filter that I showed you guys earlier, right here.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:47:23
This will be set to auto insurance. And the last one was for coat number rites. Coat number is gonna be.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:47:31
Take this book number 10. Code number 9.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:47:36
Number 7. What is the number? Is it coming from Guideware, or VR?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:47:42
Well, they have some numbers? Coming from library. Yeah, it's this.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:47:47
Um, why this is tricky, okay. out-of-the-box field? Yeah, yeah, correct.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:47:53
They're going to add the… I think they added already to the account's response.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:47:58
when they're retrieving the… code select in itself, they are giving it.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:48:06
That's done with this one.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:48:10
Okay. Any more questions on this?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:48:17
The umbrella UI, right, is exactly like this portion.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:48:22
They also have this, you know. the way it is displayed, right?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:48:27
code number… Yeah, yeah. specifically for spouse and, um.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:48:32
Okay. That number, we are not going to do anything, JP, so whatever the number we are getting from GuideWare will display. If number is… Mm-hmm.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:48:44
Okay.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:48:50
Okay, we are good to go to the next one.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:49:00
We had 3 features of Forum, am I missing something here?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:49:04
We have 366, 68, and 9, so 68. Again, same capability, part number 132368, it's for CAP 32.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:49:15
362, the Zoom Acquisition and Servicing. And, uh, here?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:49:23
The ability to view Quote Hub UI, card for view details, policy details, differences, unique code number.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:49:30
code created by user on?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:49:41
So, scenario, Safe Code Hub, AutoCards, policy details, differences.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:49:47
display the following on top of card. Under both new policies and policy updates tabs.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:49:58
Code number, followed by a unique code number originated from Guidewire.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:50:03
By followed by the first name of the spouse, limited to 20 characters only.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:50:08
When the quote was entered by the spouse. P&L.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:50:14
And, uh… Month, uh, plus 3 characters, followed by… End date.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:50:24
the day the code was first created as per design, and spouse or a sponsor name will be displayed only when.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:50:30
What is not created by the P&I. Data should not change, because it would be the date when the quote was created for the first time.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:50:40
In that same section.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:50:49
This one, or… It's just describing the first part of the card.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:51:02
Order policy premium. Great, good.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:51:09
While reading this feature. Monica, are you still on?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:51:19
Monica?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:51:26
I'm not… I see you unmuted, but I'm not able to hear you.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:51:30
I'm thinking, instead of getting a new feature, should we use this one?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:51:36
An extended for all the card-related information.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:51:49
Right. I'm thinking we'll take it. She responded. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I just saw that.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:51:55
Maybe what we'll do is, we have… For some reason, the ability to mixed with the.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:52:01
Different feature, 70 and 76. For acquisition and servicing in there.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:52:08
Oh, actually, no, we cannot do that. Because this is a common one, which only calls out differences.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:52:15
differences alone. 2.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:52:19
It's a little confusing because our ability to is… Calling about everything, policy details, differences, unique code created by.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:52:30
We just open a… That gets delivered from the… From the Port Hub SME, this was… This should have been related from the wiki, actually.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:52:42
I'm gonna leave it for now. I'll update the wiki and then update the IT if needed.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:52:48
Yeah, stigma as well, right? Yeah, this is any on any card.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:52:52
Monica will keep it separate because of… This is only dedicated to this section.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:52:56
So anywhere you can see this. Just calling out these differences.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:53:03
And it also gives a… This… this thing, the 20 characters is what's allowed, so even if it's a longer name, we'll only show 20 characters maximum.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:53:14
Uh… Very strict.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:53:20
Yes, here, limited to 20 characters. Just the first name, I think. Yes.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:53:28
First name of the spouse? Anthony.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:53:42
I'll go to the next AC. There are no questions?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:53:48
Can we paste that Figma link in Zoom chat?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:53:50
I know you love data feature. I don't know when I will be able to do that, yeah, but this one we can actually put in.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:53:59
Cause this will be… Cool. There's a link to selection.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:54:05
So this one I'll paste here. From the removal of this.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:54:13
You don't need… Let's just make this one.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:54:24
No, you should be fine, JP. At least this one we have the… Seriously. Okay.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:54:31
Good that you called it out, thank you. Moving on, 1, 3, 2, 3, 6, 9.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:54:41
This is in… When member resumes an acquisition or servicing code from the court of ability to refresh effective date, company of placement, eligibility, etc. On resume code.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:54:56
The ability to check for out-of-sequence or invalid scenarios.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:54:59
The ability to capture premium chains. Next is ability to present blue interstitial page when refresh is being processed.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:55:07
In the flow for acquisition and servicing, member will land either on speed bump or code flow.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:55:11
An ability to present speed bumpage during acquisition resume.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:55:16
Due to… eligibility check or premium changes, premium comparison of older versus new version will needed to.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:55:25
address this model of. We will change need.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:55:31
additional details on messaging, ability to present speed bump during servicing.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:55:35
So this was acquisition, the servicing resumed due to premium changes are invalid.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:55:40
Put adjustment or sequence. An ability to present exit model and speed bump pays for premium changes closed.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:55:49
During acquisition and servicing quotes, so navigate them to Safe Code Hub or Member Home.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:55:54
Or navigate back to speed up. speed bump in ability to land safe code hub when speed bump page.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:56:01
is closed or invalid code adjustment. Inability to navigate to Acquisition servicing flow when member chooses to.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:56:09
Continue in the speed mode. So there are this new concept of speed bump pages that is being introduced.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:56:18
Those come into play when you hit continue here, and something has changed.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:56:23
border code. So, whether it is acquisition or servicing.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:56:29
There is… there are two buttons, continue, or in certain cases, we display finish later.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:56:34
These requirements are part of a different feature. So when they do either, that means they want to continue with the code.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:56:42
In that case, we will refresh the code. To make sure that it is still accurate.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:56:48
It can happen that the premium may change. Or company of placement may change.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:56:54
Or for servicing, renewal has happened, or an out-of-sequence has come into play, or… One of these. So in those cases, instead of taking the member directly into acquisition or servicing workflow.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:57:05
We will first launch. these interim pages. So when the refresh is happening, we will show this blue interstitial.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:57:14
And refresh behind the scenes is done. We will show them these speed bump pages. There are four flavors.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:57:21
Premium change? And company of placement.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:57:28
Room change can happen any. company of placement is specific to acquisition. With term, we don't change company in servicing, and then.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:57:38
Servicing alone, we have invalid adjustment when there is out of sequence.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:57:42
Out there in this renewal, when there is a transaction.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:57:45
pending, but… But there's transaction quoted.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:57:49
But the renewal has passed, and that transaction becomes… unavailable. So these 4 scenarios is what we are going to look at.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:57:58
I'm gonna make sure that I copy and put this link in the… Make sure if it's not there already.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:58:07
So, when they click resume or finish quote in the Safe Code Hub, first they see the.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:58:13
Refresh is happening, so they see this. Only if one of these.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:58:18
Conditions. Condition. Then we show them this page. If nothing else of this sort has happened, then they directly go into the.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:58:26
workflow for acquisition and servicing. But if something has changed because of one of these reasons, then they will see that.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:58:33
Corresponding speed bump. Okay. Now… There is…

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:58:56
Yeah, first, let's treat the ICs. Then I will try to find the… Designs needed.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:59:06
I think we have the right link here, but…

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:59:15
The link is broken again.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:59:30
Okay. Put the right link in here. So I'm gonna read the ICs. Any questions on whatever I described so far?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:59:43
So, we got one feature yesterday, like, uh… The API is telling, uh, the… what the landing page is gonna be like when they… Resume the quote, right?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 22:59:56
So, for this feature, it's… It's just, like, get… The information on the landing page, when you call that API, and then… route to that particular page.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:00:14
The processing part is mostly… Being done by the APA, so just… It's just routing.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:00:25
Within the… Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:00:29
That's what I'm talking about.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:00:33
Yep. My understanding is, yeah, yeah, that's fine, that's accurate only.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:00:40
So if you want to drive… anyhow, we are going to derive all this data in behind us in API.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:00:46
And API can send you whether to send to speed bump page with speed bump page, or which page, or the trap page, all those things, API can send it to you, so that you can.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:00:55
You can do it, but we need to satisfy all these rules on the API conditions.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:01:03
Correct, so it's more like validation from the US, right? Processing part is heavily done by the occasion.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:01:08
Yeah, that API is also you only write it.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:01:11
Your napping's late, you need to see all these rules.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:01:17
What do you need to send? Which basically you need to send, whether a speed bump is or premium change, or continue.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:01:26
Or where you need to… are trapped. Based on all these conditions, right, you need to.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:01:31
Right, these conditions there. Indeed. Yep, yep.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:01:38
Yeah, okay. Or you want to do a smart routing on UI, that is also fine for me.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:01:47
But the API would be greater, so that we can log it properly.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:01:52
Hmm.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:01:59
We woke up in my early morning.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:02:04
We can proceed. That guy is still in sleep.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:02:14
Okay. So, given member. Then launch the interstitial blue.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:02:25
And trigger underlying guideway resume logic refresh the effective date company of.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:02:33
placement eligibility as applicable, check for out-of-sequence or invalid scenarios as applicable, and capture premium change as applicable.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:02:42
Where this is, again, repeated here, the same thing, spouse name.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:02:49
Alright, okay. Next is the premium. So this is just saying that?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:02:54
Initiate refresh on click of cut. in your finish quote, ensure the loosenal interstitial valve.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:03:00
The reflection is in process behind the scenes. scenario 2 is, uh…

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:03:12
Given the safe quarter premium change speed bump, given members on Safe Quota when resuming a port and you notice a booster.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:03:19
Interstation displace, meaning refresh is happening. And rent premium changes identified, then take the member to premium change speed bump and show content we have updated.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:03:30
a new premium with the dollar amount and previous amount.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:03:33
was this dollar per month. And continue CTA as per your design and content in Figma, and clicking continue should take the member.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:03:41
and go to Zoom Code Workflow, and… Uh, well, including acquisition.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:03:46
Or servicing, actually. STVC as applicable. Code change can happen in servicing as well.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:03:56
Premium chain, sorry.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:04:01
So this is talking about… This particular premium change speed bump page, we display this message. We updated your code to reflect our latest benefits and options. New premium.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:04:12
And this would be the device premium, and this would be the own premium.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:04:17
And continued. Any questions?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:04:28
Good. So you've got a company of placement or risk code, speed bump acquisition.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:04:33
Even members on Safe Code Haban is resuming a quote, and universal blue interstation with baseloader display.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:04:40
Company of placement is identified, or. Risk code is changed from underwriting.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:04:47
Take the member to company of placement. This could change speed bump screen and show content this code is no longer, and you can return and show return to safe code CTA.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:04:57
Then clicking return to safe code should take the member back to.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:05:01
So this is the company of placement or risk code.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:05:06
speed bump, it is applicable only in acquisition. And here, if either of this happens, then they cannot resume this port.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:05:15
So we cannot show the continue button, we show the return to safe code button only.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:05:20
And when they click this CD, they go back to the safe portal.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:05:28
Questions? Straightforward, okay. Next is, uh… Uh, renewal… put past renewal date, speed bump?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:05:41
Given Amazon safeguit Hub and resuming a servicing code, and quote was originally created before.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:05:45
The renewal effective date. And universal blue interstitial.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:05:51
When this displays and code is retrieved after initial effective date.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:05:56
Then take the member to renewal court. renewal state bump and show content your date and update to this quote and show continue CT.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:06:21
Any questions?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:06:29
Even team is silent, you need to read faster.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:06:34
I guess that we can run away. Right? Yeah, your renewal date has passed. Update to this code will be applied to your current policy when you finish making changes. Continue.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:06:44
So, this continues what they click, and they go in the workflow.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:06:49
Nothing else. Okay. When you don't get any questions for long.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:06:55
Then it becomes concerning, right? Thanks a lot.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:07:00
Either it is too simple or. Maybe people are not following.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:07:05
Anyways, I tried to dig in a lot for this invalid adjustment one.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:07:11
But I didn't find anything other than out of sequence, so that's what is listed here.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:07:15
Okay, so this is for servicing again. Given members on Safe CodeHub and resuming a servicing code and the balloon interstitial is displaying.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:07:23
Meaning refresh is happening. When invalid adjustments are identified on code due to order sequence transaction.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:07:29
Then take the member to invalid adjustment speed bump, and show your quote is no longer and your policy was updated, and so go to Policy Summary and return to Quote CTS.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:07:40
Go to Policy Summary, takes the member to Policy Summary.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:07:43
And return to save code, take the member to Safe Code Hub.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:07:46
So this is the… This one, it's only applicable to servicing, like I said, and only in case of order sequence.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:07:55
If they entered a code and then they. process around the court, and now this court is out of sequence.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:08:00
Then we will show this one, and show code poly summary in return to safe code buttons.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:08:10
Yeah, I'm assuming no questions, so I will move on.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:08:14
Last day. Safe code hub, speed bump, General Behavior Acquisition Servicing.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:08:19
When member is on any speed bump screen during a resume transaction, when they click the USA logo.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:08:25
Then take them to member home. And when they click the X button.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:08:29
Then take them to Safe Code Hub. Where they originated from.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:08:34
chat icon should launch. This is standard, right? Chat icon launches, whatever it launches.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:08:39
But at any time. They click either the logo or the logo, then they go to member home, and they click the cross button, they go back to.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:08:49
the Safe Code Hub. That's… there is no model on top of this model, because there's already a model, so… Disclosing it takes them back to SafeHub, and clicking this takes them to member home.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:09:04
Any questions?

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:09:11
That was the last feature, right? Yes. No, that's good.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:09:18
There's no questions. I would like to take a 4-minute break before the refinement begins.

[Nihanth BhimiReddy] 23:09:21
Yeah, that's a go-forward. Please, please. Thank you guys, um, appreciate everything.
