Hi Nadhni, as discussed, could you please create a feature branch named feature/employee-registration and push your initial code there? Since we don’t have a separate develop branch, we can use this as the common base branch. Once it’s ready, the rest of the team can create their own private branches from it and push their changes there. This approach will help us avoid code conflicts and make it easier to reuse common components before merging everything into the main branch. Let me know your thoughts
