# 🔎 1. Profile Fit Check (Mandatory Before Contact)

Verify:

☐ Skills match JD (not just keyword stuffing)  
☐ Experience level matches requirement  
☐ Relevant project/domain exposure  
☐ Stability acceptable (avoid extreme job hopping unless freelance role)  
☐ Experience depth in required tech stack  

If major mismatch → Do NOT message.

---

# 👀 2. Activity Validation

Open LinkedIn profile and confirm:

☐ Open to Work badge OR Immediate Joiner mentioned  
☐ Posted or commented within last 30 days  
☐ Profile updated recently  
☐ Detailed About / Projects section  

Priority order:
1. Recently active
2. Open to Work
3. Recently changed job (last 6 months)

If inactive 6+ months → Low priority.

---

# 📂 3. Shortlist Criteria

Add to project folder only if:

☐ Strong skill match  
☐ Active profile  
☐ Relevant tech stack depth  
☐ Experience aligned with JD  

Target: 15–25 high-quality profiles per session.

Quality > Quantity

---

# 💡 4. Warm-Up Step (Before Messaging)

☐ View profile (10–20 seconds minimum)  
☐ Like 1 recent post (if available)  
☐ Optional: leave short genuine comment  
☐ Wait 30–60 minutes before messaging  

This increases familiarity and response rate.

# 🤝 5. Preferred Approach: Personalized Connection Request (Instead of InMail)

## Why Prefer Connection Request?

✔ Higher acceptance rate  
✔ More natural conversation flow  
✔ Saves InMail credits  
✔ Less sales-like approach  
✔ Better long-term relationship building  

Use InMail only if:
- Candidate has InMail Open Profile
- Very urgent hiring
- Senior executive hiring
- Connection request limit reached

---

## 📌 Connection Request Structure (Max 300 Characters)

Keep short and natural.

Example:

Hi [Name],  
Came across your experience in [Skill/Tech]. Would love to connect and explore a potential opportunity aligned with your background.

Do NOT:
- Share full JD
- Ask for phone number
- Write long paragraph

Goal = Get connection accepted.

---

# 💬 6. Message After Connection Acceptance

Send structured short message:

☐ 1 personalized line  
☐ Clear role  
☐ Mention duration / remote / contract type  
☐ Soft CTA  

Example:

Hi [Name],

Noticed your work on large-scale Python data pipelines.

We’re hiring for a 3–6 month data engineering engagement (Spark + Hugging Face, Remote).

Would you be open to a quick 10-min discussion?

Keep under 6 lines.

---

# ⏳ 7. Follow-Up Plan

Follow up after 3–4 days if no response.

☐ Keep it short (2–3 lines)  
☐ Maintain professional tone  
☐ No pressure  

Example:

Hi [Name],  
Just checking if you had a chance to review my message. Happy to share more details if you're open.

---

# 📊 8. Daily Performance Tracking

Track daily:

☐ Connection requests sent: _____  
☐ Connection acceptances: _____  
☐ Messages sent: _____  
☐ Replies received: _____  
☐ Calls scheduled: _____
